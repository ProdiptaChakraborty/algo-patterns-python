# DSA Playbook — Python

A curated collection of Python implementations of core algorithmic patterns frequently used (efficient lookup, linear-time scanning patterns, graph traversal, and dynamic programming).

Each solution is written to be readable and reusable:
- concise context + approach summary
- a correctness sketch (key invariant / reasoning)
- time & space complexity
- clean, typed Python

## Organization

Solutions are grouped by topic under `topics/`.

File naming includes a source prefix:
- `lc_` — LeetCode
- `misc_` — other sources 

Example:
- `topics/arrays/lc_0001_two_sum.py`
